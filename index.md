### Features


- Track 3D annotations in time-series images including neuronal spines and cell bodies.
- Automatically aligns images and annotations across time-points.
- Designed to work with in vivo, ex vivo, and fixed tissue image volumes.

### Analysis
 - Track the dynamics of 3D annotations including persistence, addition, and subtraction.
 - Trajectory analysis to track the motility of annotations.
 - Neuronal spine intensity analysis.
  
### Gallery

- Please see the [Gallery][6] for movies and screen shots of Map Manager in action.
