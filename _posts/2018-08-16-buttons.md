The buttons window is an easy interface to control the dispay of [stack][stack] and [map plot][map-plot] windows.

Open the buttons window with the main menu 'Map Manager - Buttons' or use keyboard <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd> ('1' is the number one).

### Channels

The 1, 2, and 3 buttons will display the specified color channel.

The RGB button will display an RGB image for stacks with 2 or more color channels. The channel order/color is specified in ' Map Manager - [options][options] - stack display - channel order.

### Sliding-Z

Create a sliding z-projection for the stack.

Turn on the 'options' checkbox to set the number of slices that contribute to each slice in the sliding-z projection and the type of projection. Available projections are: Maximal projection (default), Average Projection (good for time series), and SDEV Projection (the standard deviation projection).

### Info

Toggle annotation info panel. This can also be done in a stack window with keyboard <kbd>i</kbd>.

### Contrast bar

Toggle the stack window contrast bar. This can also be done in a stack window with keyboard <kbd>c</kbd>.

### Histogram, Z-Projection, Point List, Find Points

Open a new window showing an image intensity histogram, a Z-Projection (with options), the [Point List][point-list] window, and the [Find Points][find-points] window.

## Tabs

### Stack Tab

<IMG class="img-float-right" SRC="images/mm3/mm3-buttons-stack.png" WIDTH="250">

The stack tab controls [stack][stack] windows.

 - **Annotation Bar**. Toggle the left annotation bar. The annotation bar can also be toggled with keyboard <kbd>[</kbd>.
 - **Tracing**. Toggle the tracing on/off. This is useful to see portions of an image that might be obsured by annotations and to copy/paste raw images (without annotations) to other programs. The tracing can also be toggled with keyboard <kbd>t</kbd>.
 - **Pixel Intensity**. Toggle the display of pixel intensity. Pixel intensities are show in the lower-left of a stack window (yellow text) as the mouse cursor is moved over an image.
  - **Grid**. Toggle the display of a grid over a stack window. This is useful for scoring the number of annotations within a stack. The recipe is to annotate all objects within each square of the grid.
  - **Candy**. Select the visual candy in a stack window. Options include: All, None, Scale, Scale + Label, Scale + Label + Axis. This can also be set in a stack window using keyboard <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd>. Where 'c' is for **C**andy.
  - **Keyboard edits 'User Type'**. Toggle the editing of annotation user type with keyboard <kbd>0..9</kbd>. Normally these keystrokes will change the stack color channel display.
  - **Show 'User Type' in tag**. Toggle the display of user type in all annotation tags. More advances options can be set in the [Stack Legend][stack-legend] panel - tags section.

### Obj Map Tab

The Obj Map tab controls time-series [plots][map-plot].

 - **Bad**. Toggle overlay of bad annotations. Bad annotations appear (by default) as white.
 - **Intensity Bad**. Toggle overlay of intensity bad annotations. Intensity bad annotations appear (by default) as white. Tagging annotations as intensity bad will ignore the intensity analysis for a given annotation but keep it in the annotation dynamics calculation.
 - **Dynamics**. Toggle dynamics colors. When off, all annotations will be show black. The dynamics color can also be toggled with keyboard <kbd>d</kbd>.
 - **Raw**. Toggle annotation markers. Not very useful, should be called 'Annotation'.
 - **Lines**. NOT WORKING. Toggle segment tracing lines. Only applies to maps that have segment tracings.
 - **Forced**. Toggle 'forced' annotations on/off. Forced annotations are shown with a blue circle. This is useful to see where the user had to manually specify corresponding annotations versus annotations that were automatically linked using right-click - Dynamics - Connect Objects To next.
  - **Map Pivot**. Toggle the display of the annotation specified as a map pivot. This is only used for 'otherROI' and not used for spine annotations.
  - **Jumping**. Not Used.
  - **User Type**. Not used. Toggle the display of annotations tagged with a user type.
  - **User Boolean**. Not used. Toggle the display of annotations tagged with a user boolean.
  - **Last Search**. Toggle the display of annotations that were in the last [search][search] results.
  - **White / Black / Gray**. Buttons to control the display of a map plot. The gray level can be set and is in the range of 0..1. This is useful for copy/paste a map plot into other programs.
 - **Plot Object**. Choose the type of objects to display in a [map-plot][map-plot].
