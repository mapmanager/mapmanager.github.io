The buttons panel provides a quick interface to performing actions on [stack][1] and [map plot][2] windows.

Open the buttons panel from the main menu 'MapManager - Buttons'.

The buttons panel will adjust its interface depending on the front most Map Manager window.

The actions provided in the buttons panel are also available from individual map manager windows using a right mouse-click. The purpose of the buttons panel is to make these actions more accessible.
