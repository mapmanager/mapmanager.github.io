A map plot shows annotations versus time-points. Annotations persisting from one session to the next are connected with a line.

Open a map plot from the [time-series](time-series-panel) panel using the 'Object Map' and 'Segment Map' buttons.

### Map plots are interactive

Selecting an annotation with a left-mouse click will select the annotation run in the map plot and propagate the selection to other map plots, [stack plots][2], and [stack](stack) windows.

Selected annotations appear as yellow circles, the run of an annotation appears as a yellow line.

Right-click an annotation to [plot a run][4] of [stack](stack) plots.

**Escape**. Cancel all selections.

**Arrow-keys**. Pan the map.

**Ctrl + Mouse-click/drag**. Pan the map.

**Ctrl + Mouse-wheel**. Zoom the map.

**Enter**. Reset the map pan and zoom.

### Colors

The colors of annotations in a map plot denote their dynamics.

 - <span style="color:green">Green</span> : Added
 - <span style="color:red">Red</span> : Subtracted
 - <span style="color:blue">Blue</span> : Transient (1 session)
 - <span style="color:DarkKhaki ">Yellow</span> : Persistent
 - White : Bad
 
### Top control bar

Toggle the top control bar on and off with keyboard <kbd>c</kbd>. 

 - **Map Segment ID**. Plot individual map segments.
 - **All Segments**'. Plot all segment in a map. This is only used for spine annotations.
 - **Bad**. Toggle display of annotations tagged as bad. By default, all bad annotations are shown in white.
 - **Int Bad**. Toggle display of annotations tagged as intensity bad.
 - **Stats**. Display a table of statistics (mean/sd/se/n) for plotted data.
 - **Raw**. Display a table of raw data.

### Right-click menu

<IMG class="img-float-right" SRC="images/mm3/map-plot/map-plot-right-click.png" WIDTH="215">

 - **Plot Stack.** Open the [stack](stack) window containing the selected annotation.
 - **Plot Spine.** Open a stack window and visually snap to and select the selected annotation.
 - **Plot Run.** Open a [run plot](run-plot)
 - **Set Run Good.** Set the run to good.
 - **Set Run Bad.** Set the run to bad.
 - **Set Int Good.** Set the run to intensity good.
 - **Set Int Bad**. Set the run to intensity bad.
 - **Set run to User Type 1.** Set the run to user type 1.
 - **Set As Map Pivot.** For 'other' ROIs, set the selected annotation as a map pivot. Plotting a [run](run-plot) will use this to visually snap all [stack](stack) windows in a run.
 - **Transorm.** Tranform the Y-Axis values to: Raw (default), Absolute, Divided by, Percent, Norm 1, and Norm 2. For all selections other than Raw, the transformation will be done on the selected time-point.
 - **Dynamics.** Used to automatically connect and disconnect annotations in the selected time-point.
 - **Find Points.** Open the [Find Points](find-points-panel) panel. Use this to browse connections between time-points.
 - **Search.** Open the [search](search-panel) panel. Use this to search annotations in a map.
 - **Density Report.** Generate a density [report](reports). Use this to generate a table of spine counts and density per segment.
 - **Dynamics Report.** Generate a dynamics [report](reports). Use this to generate a table of spine dynamics across time-points including number, %, and density added and subtracted.
 - **Survival Report.** Generate a survival [report](reports). Use this to generate a table of spine survival as a function of the first session in a map.
 - **View.** A submenu where view options can be toggled. For example, the dynamics colors can be turned off with 'Dynamics'. See the buttons panel 'obj map' tab for a full set of options.

### Buttons panel 'Obj Map' tab

Open the buttons panel from the main menu 'MapManager - Buttons'.

Additional map overlays can be toggled in the 'Obj Map' tab. This includes bad, intensity bad, dynamics colors, and many more.

### Examples

There are two special map plots provided in the [time-series panel][3]: Object Map and Segment Map.

<IMG class="img-float-left" SRC="images/mm3/map-plot/map-plot-days.png" WIDTH="500">

This is an example of an 'Object Map' of spines showing the position of each spine on its dendritic segment. The lines connect persistent spines across time-points. Added spines are green, subtracted are red, and transient are blue. Spines tagged bad are in white. This plot is showing each time-point as a function of the day it was acquired with the first time-point being the zero day.

Open this kind of map plot in the [time-series](time-series-panel) panel with the 'Object Map' button. Select the 'X-Axis' as 'days'.

<div class="print-page-break"></div>

<IMG class="img-float-left" SRC="images/mm3/mm3-map1-plot.png" WIDTH="250">

A map plot of spine length in &mu;m (sLen2d) versus map session.

Open this kind of map plot in the [time-series](time-series-panel) panel, 'Intensity' tab, 'Spine Length' button.

<div class="print-page-break"></div>

<IMG class="img-float-left" SRC="images/mm3/mm3-map2-plot.png" WIDTH="250">

A map plot of spine length in &mu;m (sLen2d) for time-point 1 versus time-point 0. Each point is the length of a single spine measured in session 0 (bottom axis) and again in session 1 (left axis).

Open this kind of map plot in the [plot](plot-panel) panel.
