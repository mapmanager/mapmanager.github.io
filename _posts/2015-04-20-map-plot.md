A map plot shows annotations versus time-points. Objects persisting from one session to the next are connected with a line.

All map plots are highly interactive. Selecting an object will propagate this selection to other map and [stack plots][2]. Right-click an object to [plot a run][4].

There are two special plots provided in the [time-series panel][3]: Object Map and Segment Map.

#### Colors

The colors of objects in a map denote their dynamics.

 - <span style="color:green">Green</span> : Added
 - <span style="color:red">Red</span> : Subtracted
 - <span style="color:blue">Blue</span> : Transient (1 session)
 - <span style="color:DarkKhaki ">Yellow</span> : Persistent
 - White : Bad
 
#### Top control bar

Toggle the top control bar on and off with keyboard 'c'. 

 - **Segment ID**. Plot individual segments. Use '**All Segments**' to plot all segment. This is only used for spine annotations.
 - **Bad**. Toggle display of annotations tagged as bad.
 - **Int Bad**. Toggle display of annotations tagged as intensity bad.
 - **Stats**. Display a table of statistics (mean/sd/se/n) for plotted data.
 - **Raw**. Display a table of raw data.
 
### Examples

There are two special plots provided in the [time-series panel][3]: Object Map and Segment Map. A large number of plots can be generated using the [plot panel][1].

<IMG class="img-float-left" SRC="images/mm3/map-plot/map-plot-days.png" WIDTH="500">

This is an example of a 'Spine Map' showing the position of each spine on its dendritic segment. The lines connect persistent spines across time-points. Added spines are green, subtracted are red, and transient are blue. Spines tagged bad are in white. This plot is showing each time-point as a function of the day it was acquired with the first time-point being the zero day.

<IMG class="img-float-left" SRC="images/mm3/mm3-map1-plot.png" WIDTH="250">

A map plot of spine length in &mu;m (sLen2d) versus map session.

<div class="print-page-break"></div>

<IMG class="img-float-left" SRC="images/mm3/mm3-map2-plot.png" WIDTH="250">

A map plot of spine length in &mu;m (sLen2d) for time-point 1 versus time-point 0. Each point is the length of a single spine measured in session 0 (bottom axis) and again in session 1 (left axis).
