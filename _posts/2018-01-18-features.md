### Import image volume time-series

- #### Works with any in vivo, ex vivo, and fixed tissue image volumes.
- #### Automatically aligns images and annotations across timepoints.

### Annotate

- #### Create and curate 3D annotations.
- #### Track 3D annotations in time-series images.

### Analysis

- #### Analyze the dynamics of annotations.
- #### Spine intensity analysis.
- #### Trajectory analysis.
  
### Extending the analysis

 - [Map Manager - Matlab][1] is a Matlab class library that will open and plot Map Manager (Igor) files. This allows the analysis created by Map Manager to be customized to meet the requirements of each experiment.

### Gallery

- #### See the [Gallery][6] for movies and screen shots of Map Manager in action.
