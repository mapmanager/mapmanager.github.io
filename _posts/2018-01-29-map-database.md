The map database provides an interface to display folders of maps from the hard-drive.

Open the Map Database using the 'Map DB' button in the [time-series](time-series-panel) panel.

Use the **Set** button to set the hard-drive path to search and to build the database. This path is saved when options are saved with the main menu 'MapManager - Save Options...'.

Double clicking on a map in the map database will open it into the Map Manager [time-series](time-series-panel) panel.

### Advanved use

The map database shows the status of the file version of each map. In rare cases, Map Manager file formats might not be back-ward compatible. **This has never happened**. If the maps are displaying green in the 'fileVersion' column, everything is good.
