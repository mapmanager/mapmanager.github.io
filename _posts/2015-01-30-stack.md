<div class="print-page-break"></div>

### Multiple color channels

For image stacks with more than one color channel, use keyboard <kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>2</kbd>, and <kbd>3</kbd> to switch between channels one, two, and three. Color channels can also be switched using the [buttons][buttons] window or the mouse right-click menu 'view'.

<IMG class="img-float-right" SRC="images/contrast-bar.png" WIDTH="500">

### Image contrast

<div class="print-page-break"></div>

Open the contrast bar with keyboard <kbd>c</kbd>, the right-click menu 'View - Contrast Bar', or use the [buttons][buttons] paenl 'contrast bar'.

<span style="color:red">Image contrast is critical</span>. If contrast is not set properly, dim but otherwise important structures in an image may not be visible. Setting the contrast does not modify the image, it is purely for visualization. To acheive optimal contrast, use the histogram (keyboard <kbd>h</kbd>) to choose the image contrast based on the intensity values in an image.

- **Min.** Pixel intensity values below 'min' will be displayed as black (default). Turn on the color checkbox and select a color for pixels below 'min'.
- **Max.** Pixel intensity values above 'max' will be displayed as white (default). Turn on the color checkbox and select a color for pixels above 'max'.
- **Color Look-up-table popup.** Choose a color look-up-table (LUT). For example, gray, green ,red, etc. etc.
- **Invert.** Invert the selected color LUT.
- **Log.** Display the image intensities using log (intensity).
- **Top/Bottom.** Turn on this checkbox to set a min/max contrast for both the top and bottom of an image volume. The contrast will be linearly adjusted for each slice. This is useful for image volumes that get darker at deeper depths.

<IMG class="img-float-right" SRC="images/mm3/mm3-process-panel.png" WIDTH="375">

#### Global image contrast

The global contrast panel provides an interface to set display parameters for all displayed stacks. The values specified in this panel will be used each time a new stack window is opened. This is useful if all your stacks have the same bit-depth and approximately the same brightness.

Open the global contrast panel with the main Map Manager menu 'MapManager - Contrast'

The check boxes next to each channel specify if the value are to be used when a stack is opened.

The values can be saved from the [Options Panel][2] or the main Map Manager menu 'MapManager - Save Options...'.


<div class="print-page-break"></div>


<IMG class="img-float-right" SRC="images/mm3/mm3-stack-right-click.png" WIDTH="175">

### Right click

Right-click on the image and you will get a contextual menu to activate the features described on this page. Many of the options available in the right-click menu can also be set using the [buttons][buttons] window.

<div class="print-page-break"></div>

<IMG class="img-float-right" SRC="images/mm3/mm3-buttons.png" WIDTH="225">

### Buttons window

<a id="buttons-panel"></a>


The [buttons][buttons] window provides a quick interface to perform actions on stack and [map plot](map-plot) windows. The actions provided in the buttons window are also available from individual map manager windows using a mouse right-click.

Open the buttons window from the main menu 'MapManager - Buttons' or use keyboard <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd>.

Once open, the buttons window will automatically update based on the front-most Map Manager window. The 'stack' tab is for setting stack windows, the 'Obj Map' tab for setting [map plot](map-plot) windows and the 'Report' tab is for generating [reports][reports].



<div class="print-page-break"></div>

<IMG class="img-float-right" SRC="images/imagingcore/histogram.jpg" WIDTH="350">

### Histogram

The histogram window show a histogram of pixel intensity values for each image in a stack.

Open the histogram window with keyboard <kbd>h</kbd>, the right-click menu, or the [buttons][buttons] window.

- The histogram window shows a pixel intensity histogram for one image. The y-axis is a log scale. This is useful because most images will have an order-of-magnitude more dark pixels, a log scale allows the contributions of the generally brighter signal pixels to be seen.
- Scroll through the image in a stack (mouse-wheel) and the histogram for each image will be show.
- Use the histogram to select the appropriate image contrast (top values and slider) for each stack.

<div class="print-page-break"></div>


### Sliding z-projection and frame averaging

A sliding z-projection is a special stack where each image plane is replaced by a small z-projection showing slices just above and below the current image plane. For frame averaging, each image is replaced by the average of itself with a number of frames after it.

Switch channels or to a sliding z-projection using the following table. This is also available in the [buttons][buttons] window.

**Important.** Switch to a sliding z-projection with <kbd>shift</kbd> to set the sliding z-projection options including the number of slices and the type of projection (Maximal, Frame Average, Standard Deviation). For example, if you have one channel images, <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd> will allow you to set the sliding z-projection options.

|---+---+---+---+---
| # Ch / Keyboard	|<kbd>1</kbd>	|<kbd>2</kbd>	|<kbd>3</kbd>	|<kbd>4</kbd>	|<kbd>5</kbd>	|<kbd>6</kbd>
| 1 Channel			|Channel 1	|N/A	| Sliding-Z Channel 1			| N/A			| N/A	| N/A
| 2 Channels		|Channel 1	|Channel 2		| Sliding-Z Channel 1	| Sliding-Z Channel 2	| N/A	| N/A
| 3 Channels		|Channel 1	|Channel 2		| Channel 3 			| Sliding-Z Channel 1	| Sliding-Z Channel 2	| Sliding-Z Channel 3

##### Here are some examples of the sliding z-projection in action.

	</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Maximal Z-Projections

Open a maximal Z-Projection with keyboard <kbd>z</kbd> or use the right-click menu. 

Once the Z-Projection window is open, it behaves just like a stack window (with only one slice). For example, you can zoom with keyboard <kbd>+</kbd>/<kbd>-</kbd> or <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + mouse-wheel, pan with <kbd>arrow keys</kbd> or mouse click+drag, open the contrast bar with keyboard <kbd>c</kbd>, view a histogram with keyboard <kbd>h</kbd>, copy/paste the image to another program, etc., etc.


### Scale bar
Each stack will display a white scale bar in &micro;m. Control the length and thickness of the scale bar in [Options][2] Stack Display - Scale Bar. The scale bar can be hidden and displayed using 'Window Candy'.

### Window Candy

There are five different window decorations or **c**andy options. Cycle different window **c**andies with keyboard <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd>.
  1. None
  2. Scale Bar
  3. Scale Bar + Top Left Label
  4. Scale Bar + Top Left Label + Axis
  5. Scale Bar + Top Left Label + Axis + Slider

Set the default window **c**andy in [Options][2] - Stack Display - Default Stack Candy. 


### Stack annotations
<a id="stack-annotations"></a>

<IMG class="img-float-right" SRC="images/mm3/stack/stack-control-bars.png" WIDTH="500">

To manage annotations in a stack window, open the left control bar with keyboard <kbd>[</kbd> or use the [point list][4] panel.

See [stack annotations][3] for details on creating and editing annotations.

 - **Create an annotation.** Shift+click to create a new annotation. **All annotations are 3D**, the x/y coordinate is given by the position of the mouse cursor and the z coordinate is the currently viewed image slice. 
 - **Select an annotation.** Single-click to select an annotation. Selected annotations are yellow. Cancel the selection with keyboard <kbd>esc</kbd>.
 - **Move an annotation.** Right-click and select 'move' menu.
 - **Delete an annotation.** Keyboard <kbd>del</kbd> or right-click and select 'delete'.
 - **Setting an annotation tag.** Use the right-click menu. Tags include: bad, intensity bad, and user type.
 - **Setting an annotation note.** Select the annotation and press keyboard <kbd>n</kbd>.
 
 <div class="print-page-break"></div>


<img class="img-float-right" SRC="images/mm3/mm3-point-info.png" WIDTH="300">

### Point info

The Point Info window shows information about the currently selected object.  

- Open the Point Info window from any stack window using keyboard <kbd>i</kbd>.  
- Use the point info window to annotate objects with text notes.



<div class="print-page-break"></div>

<IMG class="img-float-right" SRC="images/imagingcore/stack_navigation.jpg" WIDTH="300">

### Navigation window

The navigation window opens a new window with a maximal z-projection of the stack and shows the current zoomed view as a blue square.

- Right click and select 'Navigation Window' menu. A navigation window will be opened and your current zoomed view of the stack will be shown as a blue square.
- Zoom with <kbd>+</kbd>/<kbd>-</kbd> or pan with <kbd>arrow keys</kbd> and the blue-square tracks what you are looking at.
- The navigation window is, by default, a maximal z-projection of the entire stack.

<div class="print-page-break"></div>

### Zoom window

Right click and select 'Zoom Window'. The zoom window will follow the mouse pointer and show a zoomed in region of the current image.


### Animating a stack or frame scan

Keyboard <kbd>/</kbd> to start/stop an animation through all slices or frames. Use <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd> to set the frame rate and if the animation will loop. Use keyboard <kbd>/</kbd> or keyboard <kbd>.</kbd> to stop the animation.



### Copy/Paste image into other programs

Igor Pro is very good at copying images to the clipboard so they can be pasted into other programs. From a stack window, copying will copy the image with all the annotations, it does not copy the contrast (top) and scoring (left) toolbars. Annotations can be hidden with <kbd>t</kbd>.


<IMG class="img-float-right" SRC="images/voxel-size-panel.png" WIDTH="350">

### Voxel size

In most cases the voxel size will be set automatically. The x/y/z voxel size of each stack is set with keyboard <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>. **Setting the correct voxel size in &micro;m is critical** as MapManager performs many calculations in &micro;m (NOT IN PIXELS). The voxel size must be set before annotations are created. Once annotations are created, you should not change the voxel size.

<div class="print-page-break"></div>

### Stack window keyboard shortcuts

Map Manager makes heavy use of keyboard shortcuts. All of these keyboard shortcuts are available in the mouse right-click menu (which also lists the corresponding keyboard shortcut) and in the [buttons][buttons] window.

#### Stack window keyboard shortcuts to display image channels

Depending on the number of color channels in an image, color channels can be switch using keyboard <kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>2</kbd>, and <kbd>3</kbd>. This includes single color channels, sliding z-projections, and merged RGB. It may be easiest to use the [buttons][buttons] window to set the displayed color channel.

**Important.** Switch to a sliding z-projection with <kbd>shift</kbd> to set the sliding z-projection options. For example, if you have one channel images, <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd> will allow you to set the sliding z-projection options.

|---+---+---+---+---
| # Ch / Keyboard	|<kbd>1</kbd>	|<kbd>2</kbd>	|<kbd>3</kbd>	|<kbd>4</kbd>	|<kbd>5</kbd>	|<kbd>6</kbd>
| 1 Channel			|Channel 1	|N/A	| Sliding-Z Channel 1			| N/A			| N/A	| N/A
| 2 Channels		|Channel 1	|Channel 2		| Sliding-Z Channel 1	| Sliding-Z Channel 2	| RGB	| N/A
