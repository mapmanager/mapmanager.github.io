### Image contrast

The contrast bar is used to set image contrast in a stack window. Image contrast is <span style="color:red">critical</span>, if contrast is not set properly you may not see dim but otherwise important structures in your images. Setting the contrast does not modify the image, it is purely for display purposes.

- Open the contrast bar with keyboard <kbd>c</kbd> or use the right-click menu 'View - Contrast Bar'.
- Pixel intensity values below 'min' will be displayed as black
- Pixel intensity values above 'max' will be displayed as white


<IMG class="img-float-right" SRC="images/mm3/mm3-process-panel.png" WIDTH="375">

### Global image contrast

The global contrast panel provides an interface to set display parameters for all stacks. The values specified in this panel will be used each time a new stack window is opened.

Open the contrast panel with the main Map Manager menu 'MapManager - Contrast'

The check boxes next to each channel specify if the value are to be used when a stack is opened.

The values can be saved from the [Options Panel][2] or the main Map Manager menu 'MapManager - Save Options...'.


<div class="print-page-break"></div>

<IMG class="img-float-right" SRC="images/imagingcore/histogram.jpg" WIDTH="350">

### Histogram

The histogram window show a histogram of pixel intensity values for each image in a stack.

- Open the histogram window with keyboard <kbd>h</kbd> or use the right-click menu.
- The histogram window shows a pixel intensity histogram for one image.
- Scroll through the image in a stack (mouse-wheel) and the histogram for each image will be show.

<div class="print-page-break"></div>

### Multiple color channels

Use keyboard <kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>2</kbd>, and <kbd>3</kbd> to switch between channels one, two, and three. Channels can also be selected using the right-click menu.

### Sliding z-projection

A sliding z-projection is a special stack where each image plane is replaced by a small maximal z-projection showing slices just above and below the current image plane. Here is an example:

<table id="videotable">
<tr>
	<td>
	Raw<br>
	<video src="images/mm3/stack/vasc_rawstack.mov" height="240" width="240" controls>
	   Your browser does not support the HTML5 video element
	</video>
	</td>

	<td>
	Sliding Z-Project<br>
	<video src="images/mm3/stack/vasc_zstack.mov" height="240" width="240" controls>
	   Your browser does not support the HTML5 video element
	</video>
	</td>
</tr>
</table>

Switch to a sliding z-projection for channel 1 with keyboard <kbd>3</kbd> and for channel 2 with keyboard <kbd>4</kbd>. You can also use the right-click menu.

Switch to the sliding z-projection with <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd> or <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>4</kbd> to set the number of slices in each maximal z-projection.

<div class="print-page-break"></div>

<p class="tip"><B>Tip.</B> The keyboard keys used to switch to a <B>sliding z-projection</B> change depending on the number of color channels. 
For stacks with one color channel, they become '2'.
For stacks with two color channels, they become '3' and '4'.
For stacks with three color channels, they become '4', '5', and '6'.
</p>




<div class="print-page-break"></div>

### Maximal Z-Projections

Open a maximal Z-Projection with keyboard <kbd>z</kbd> or use the right-click menu. This allows you to set the top and bottom slice that goes into the Z-Projection.

Once the Z-Projection window is open, it behaves just like a stack window (with only one slice). For example, you can zoom with <kbd>+</kbd>/<kbd>-</kbd>, pan with <kbd>arrow keys</kbd>, open the contrast bar with keyboard <kbd>c</kbd>, view a histogram with keyboard <kbd>h</kbd>, and copy/paste the image to another program, etc., etc.


### Scale bar
Each stack will display a white scale bar in &micro;m. Control the length of the scale bar in [Options][2]. 

### Window Candy
 - There are five different window decorations or **c**andy options: (i) all, (ii) none, (iii) scale, (iv) scale + scroll, and (v) something else.
 - Cycle different window **c**andies with keyboard <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd>.
 - Set the default window **c**andy in [Options][2]. 
 - Note: The grid will only display when window **c**andy is set to 'All' (when the stack axis are visible).

<IMG class="img-float-right" SRC="images/imagingcore/stack_navigation.jpg" WIDTH="300">

### Navigation window

The navigation window opens a new window with a maximal z-projection of the stack and shows the current zoomed view as a blue square.

- Right click and select 'Navigation Window' menu. A navigation window will be opened and your current zoomed view of the stack will be shown as a blue square.
- Zoom with <kbd>+</kbd>/<kbd>-</kbd> or pan with <kbd>arrow keys</kbd> and the blue-square tracks what you are looking at.
- The navigation window is, by default, a maximal z-projection of the entire stack.

<div class="print-page-break"></div>

### Zoom window

Right click and select 'Zoom Window'. The zoom window will follow the mouse pointer and show a zoomed in region of the current image.


<IMG class="img-float-right" SRC="images/mm3/mm3-stack-right-click.png" WIDTH="200">

### Right click

Right-click on the image and you will get a contextual menu to activate the features described on this page.

<div class="print-page-break"></div>


### Buttons panel

<IMG class="img-float-right" SRC="images/mm3/buttons.png" WIDTH="225">

The buttons panel provides a quick interface to perform actions on stack and [map plot](map-plot) windows.

Open the buttons panel from the main menu 'MapManager - Buttons'.

The buttons panel will adjust its interface depending on the front most Map Manager window.

The actions provided in the buttons panel are also available from individual map manager windows using a right mouse-click. The purpose of the buttons panel is to make these actions more accessible.

<div class="print-page-break"></div>


### Copy/Paste image into other programs

Igor Pro is very good at copying images to the clipboard so they can be pasted into other programs. From a stack window, copying will copy the image with all the annotations, it does not copy the contrast (top) and scoring (left) toolbars. Annotations can be hidden with <kbd>t</kbd>.


<IMG class="img-float-right" SRC="images/voxel-size-panel.png" WIDTH="350">

### Voxel size

The x/y/z voxel size of each stack is set with keyboard <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>. **Setting the correct voxel size in &micro;m is critical** as MapManager performs many calculations in &micro;m (NOT IN PIXELS). The voxel size must be set before annotations are created. Once annotations are created, you should not change the voxel size.

<div class="print-page-break"></div>

### Keyboard commands

Map Manager makes heavy use of keyboard shortcuts. Use the right click menu to see the mapping between the function and the key. Here is a list of keyboard shortcuts. In a stack window, use keyboard <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>h</kbd> to print this table.

### Stack annotations
<a id="stack-annotations"></a>

To manager annotations in a stack window, open the left control bar with keyboard <kbd>[</kbd> or use the [point list][4] panel.

See [stack annotations][3] for details on creating and editing annotations.

 - **Create an annotation.** Shift+click to create a new annotation. **All annotations are 3D**, the x/y coordinate is given by the position of the mouse cursor and the z coordinate is the currently viewed image slice. 
 - **Select an annotation.** Single-click to select an annotation. Selected annotations are yellow. Cancel the selection with keyboard <kbd>esc</kbd>.
 - **Move an annotation.** Right-click and select 'move' menu.
 - **Delete an annotation.** Keyboard <kbd>del</kbd> or right-click and select 'delete'.
 - **Setting an annotation tag.** Use the right-click menu. Tags include: bad, intensity bad, and user type.
