All reports will open a table of text that can be copy/pasted into another program for further analysis.

There are three types of reports: [stack reports](#stackreports), [segment reports](#segmentreports), and [map reports](#mapreports). 

<a name="stackreports"></a>

### Stack Reports

Stack reports display the raw data for all lines and/or all annotations in a stack. Stack reports can be generated directly from each [stack](stack) window.

<p class="tip"><B>Tip.</B> Use keyboard '[' in any stack window to open and close the left control bar.</p>

#### Line Segments

Right-click a segment and select:

 - **Edit Line Database 'e'**. To display a summary of each segment.
 - **Edit Line 'l'**. To display the entire line (all 3D points).

#### Points (Annotations)

Right-click a point/annotation and select:

 - **Edit Stack DB Table 'e'**. To display all annotations as a table.
 - **Edit Intensity Table 'i'**. To display intensity analysis for all annotations as a table. There will be a number of tables generated, one for each color channel.

### Segment Reports

#### Segment Report


A segment report display statistics for each segment in a stack. It displays the length of the segment, the number and density of spines, the x/y/z position of the segment, and the number of each user type. A segment report can be generated for individual [stacks][1] or a map. 

To generate a segment report for each segment in a stack

 - In a [stack window][1], use the 'Segment report' button in the 'Reports' tab or keyboard 'o' for **o**utput report.
 - In the [Stack Browser][3], right click a stack in the list of stacks and select 'Segment Report' or keyboard 'o' for **o**utput report
 - In the [Stack Browser][3], right click a folder in the list of folders (on the left) and select 'Segment Report (All Stacks)'.

To generate a segment report for all segments in a map

 - Right-click a map in the time-series panel and select 'Segment Report'.
 - In the time-series panel, use the 'Report' tab and button 'Segment Report - All Map'.

<IMG class="img-float-right" SRC="images/mm3/reports/segment-report-options.png" WIDTH="350">

Segment reports have some simple options.

 - **Include X/Y/Z Statistics**. Include the mean/sd/se/n for each segment tracings.
 - **Include Spine/Filament Length**. Include the mean/sd/se/n across all spines/filaments in each segment.
 - **Smooth Z (0 for none)**. Smooth the Z values of each segment tracing and report this in 'totalLen3d' column. This is useful to reduce erroneous segment length if a segment traverses a single image plane but its Z values are actually jumping up/down by a single image plane.

### Map Reports

There are two types of map reports, **Dynamics** and **Survival**. Each report begins with a header that gives information about each session in the report

|Name      |Meaning
| :-------------- | :-------------
|Idx			|Session Index
|Map			|Name of the map
|sessCond		|Session Condition
|mapSegment		|Map specific segment index (different from stackSegment)
|Stack			|Name of the stack (used internally)

|stackSegment	|Stack specific segment index (different from mapSegment)
|date			|The date the stack was acquired
|time			|The time the stack was acquired
|seconds		|The seconds the stack was acquired (from 12:00 AM on Jan 1, 1904)


#### Dynamics Report
 
A dynamics report is used for a [map][2]. For each session in a map, it will calculate the length of each segment (um), the number of added and subtracted spines, the density of added and subtracted spines, etc. etc.
 
To generate a dynamics report

- In the time-series panel, right-click a map and select 'Dynamics Report'.
- In the time-series panel, use the 'Dynamics Report' button in the 'Reports' tab.
- In any [map plot][2], right-click and select 'Dynamics Report'. If the map plot is displaying 'All Segment', a table for each segment will be opened. Otherwise, one table for the current 'Map Segment ID' will be opened.

#### Survival Report

A survival report calculates the number of objects remaining from an initial 'seed' session. Like a **Dynamics** report, it breaks down objects into different sections including all objects, followed by user type 0, followed by user type 1, etc. etc.

To generate a survival report

- In the time-series panel, right-click a map and select 'Survival Report'.

### Details on Calculations

#### Stack
Each segment within a stack has a number of spines and a total traced dendritic length. From this we can calculate spine density.

- Number of spines
- Dendrite length
- Spine density : number of spines / dendrite length

#### Map
From one session to the next, the number of added and subtracted spines are counted. From this, the percent and density changes are calculated.

- Number Added 
- Number Subtracted
- % Added : # added / (number of spines in pervious session) * 100
- % Subtracted :
- Turn-over-ratio : A measure of total dynamics (both addition and subtraction)
- Density Added : 
- Density Subtracted : 

#### Map Lifetime
Observed 

- observed sessions
- observed seconds
- observed days
- observed hours

Lifetime

- sessions
- seconds
- days
- hours

Age

- sessions
- seconds
- days
- hours

#### Svoboda style persistent and transient

Threshold time can be specified as: sessions, seconds, days, or hours.

- New Persistent : New spine that persists for > threshold time
- New Transient :
- Lost Persistent :
- Lost Transient :
- Always Present : Spines present in all sessions
