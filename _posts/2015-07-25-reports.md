All reports will open a table of text that can be copy/pasted into another program for further analysis.

There are three types of reports: [stack reports](#stackreports), [segment reports](#segmentreports), and [map reports](#mapreports). 

<a name="stackreports"></a>

### Stack Reports

Reports can be generated directly from each stack window.

<p class="tip"><B>Tip.</B> Use keyboard '[' in any stack window to open and close the left stack db panel.</p>

#### Line Segments

- Keyboard 'e' In the 'Line Segments' section of the main stack db panel to display a summary of each segment.
- Keyboard 'E' In the 'Line Segments' section of the main stack db panel to display the entire line (all 3D points)

#### Points (stack db)

- Keyboard 'e' In the 'Points' section of the main stack db panel to display the stack db as a table.
- Keyboard 'i' In the 'Points' section of the main stack db panel to display intensity analysis as a table.

### Segment Reports

#### Segment Report

A segment report display statistics for each segment in a stack. It displays the length of the segment, the number and density of spines, the x/y/z position of the segment, and the number of each user spine type (e.g. mushroom, stubby, etc.). A segment report can be generated for individual [stacks][1] or a map. 

To generate a segment report for each segment in a stack

 - In a [stack window][1], keyboard 'o' for **o**utput report.
 - In the [Stack Browser][3], select a stack in the list, keyboard 'o' for **o**utput report.
 - In the [Stack Browser][3], right click a stack in the list of stacks and select 'Segment Report'.
 - In the [Stack Browser][3], right click a folder in the list folders (on the left) and select 'Segment Report (All Stack)'.

The columns in a segment report are as follows

|Name      |Meaning
| :-------------- | :-------------
|numSpines	|Total number of spines = goodSpines + badSpines
|goodSpines	|Number of good spines.
|badSpines	|Number of bad spines.

### Map Reports

There are two types of map reports, **Dynamics** and **Survival**. Each report begins with a header that gives information about each session in the report

|Name      |Meaning
| :-------------- | :-------------
|Idx			|Session Index
|Map			|Name of the map
|sessCond		|Session Condition
|mapSegment		|Map specific segment index (different from stackSegment)
|Stack			|Name of the stack (used internally)
|originalFile	|Original file name of the stack
|stackSegment	|Stack specific segment index (different from mapSegment)
|date			|The date the stack was acquired
|time			|The time the stack was acquired
|seconds		|The seconds the stack was acquired (from 12:00 AM on Jan 1, 1904)


#### Dynamics Report
 
A dynamics report is used for a [map][2]. For each session in a map, it will calculate the length of each segment (um), the number of added and subtracted spines, the density of added and subtracted spines, etc. etc.
 
In any [map plot][2], right-click and select 'Dynamics Report'. If the map plot is displaying 'All Segment', a table for each segment will be opened. Otherwise, one table for the current 'Map Segment ID' will be opened.

The report is broken into different sections.
  
##### Information about the segment tracing

|Name      |Meaning
| :-------------- | :-------------
|totalLen2d		|Total 2D length of tracing (um)
|goodLen2d		|2D length of tracing between most distal 'good' objects (um)
|smoothPoints	|Boxcar smoothing for tracing z (0 means no smoothing)
|totalLen3d		|The smoothed total 3D length of tracing (um)
|goodLen3d		|The smoothed 3D length of tracing between most distal 'good' object (um)

##### Information about all object (ignoring user type)

|Name      |Meaning
| :-------------- | :-------------
|density		|density = nTotal / goodLen3d
|nTotal			|Total number of spines (is same as nGood + nBad)
|nGood			|Total number of good spines
|nBad			|Total number of bad spines

|nAdd			|Number of added spines.
|nSub			|Number of subtracted spines (at the current session)
|nSub2			|Number of subtracted spines (from the previous session)

#### Survival Report

A survival report calculates the number of objects remaining from an initial 'seed' session. Like a **Dynamics** report, it breaks down objects into different sections including all objects, followed by user type 0, followed by user type 1, etc. etc.

|surv_all_s0		|For each session, the number of surviving objects relative to seed session 0
|psurv_all_s0		|For each session, the fraction of surviving objects relative to seed session 0

|surv_type0_s0		|For each session, the number of surviving **user type 0** objects relative to seed session 0
|psurv_type0_s0		|For each session, the fraction of surviving **user type 0** objects relative to seed session 0

| :-------------- | :-------------
|surv_type1_s0		|For each session, the number of surviving **user type 1** objects relative to seed session 0
|psurv_type1_s0		|For each session, the fraction of surviving **user type 1** objects relative to seed session 0

##### Information about user type 2, 3, 4, 5

Other sections will be appended to the report to give information about 'user type 2', 'user type 3', 'user type 4' and 'user type 5'

### Details on Calculations

#### Stack
Each segment within a stack has a number of spines and a total traced dendritic length. From this we can calculate spine density.

- Number of spines
- Dendrite length
- Spine density : number of spines / dendrite length

#### Map
From one session to the next, the number of added and subtracted spines are counted. From this, the percent and density changes are calculated.

- Number Added 
- Number Subtracted
- % Added : # added / (number of spines in pervious session) * 100
- % Subtracted :
- Turn-over-ratio : A measure of total dynamics (both addition and subtraction)
- Density Added : 
- Density Subtracted : 

#### Map Lifetime
Observed 

- observed sessions
- observed seconds
- observed days
- observed hours

Lifetime

- sessions
- seconds

- hours

Age

#### Svoboda style persistent and transient

Threshold time can be specified as: sessions, seconds, days, or hours.

- New Persistent : New spine that persists for > threshold time
- New Transient :
- Lost Persistent :
- Lost Transient :
- Always Present : Spines present in all sessions
