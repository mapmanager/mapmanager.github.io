A stack plot shows a value/statistic for all 3D annotations in a single [stack][2]. Each point is a value/statistic for one 3D annotation in the stack.

All stack plots are interactive. Selecting an annotation will propagate this selection to other stack and [map plots][3].

Make stack plots from the main [plot panel][1].
